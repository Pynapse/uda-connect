The Location-Event Service interacts with the Location Client using gRPC message passing technique to retrieve user
coordinates. I chose the gRPC message passing technique because a high volume of user coordinate data can be sent in
concurrently, thus efficiency and great performance are imperative, and gRPC is a highly performant message passing
technique.

Between the Location-Event Service and the Location-Processor Service is a Message Queue implemented with Kafka. This
decision was made because, a distributed queue like Kafka handles large volumes of data efficiently, enabling the
Location-Processor Service not to be overwhelmed.

The Connection Service and Person Service both utilize REST for their message passing technique when interacting with
each other as well as when interacting with the Front End, this decision was made because the interactions are
synchronous and REST is performant enough to handle the requests.
